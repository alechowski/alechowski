### Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring frontend developer dedicated to expanding my knowledge of frontend technologies. I am currently seeking a place to gain my first professional experience while further developing my skills through courses and solving challenges in my own projects.

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Vue.js, my first JavaScript framework. In the near future, I plan to build an application using this framework.

Feel free to take a look at my projects! ðŸ˜„
